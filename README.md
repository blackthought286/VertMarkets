This is a tool that will allow you to 
see how many subscribers are subsrcibed
to every category of magazines published

Each user that shows up in our list must 
be subscribed to at least one magazine
in each category.

To run the code pull the project from
github. Once that is done double click
the sln file. When that opens right
click on the project and click on publish. Make sure you
publish to a local folder. 

Open up a console app and navigate to bun/release/net6.0 file
of where you published at. Run the console and you should
see a time stamp as well as the word true if the application
has the right answer.
